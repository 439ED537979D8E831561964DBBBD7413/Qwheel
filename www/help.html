<h1>SpinWheel</h1>

A common problem facing teachers is that if you pose a question to a
class, the same few students, usually in the first row, answer
them. These students are typically not representative of the class,
being more advanced and also paying attention. To get around this
problem, SpinWheel uses a spinning "prize wheel" image (+sound) to
randomly select a name from a list. Once a name is selected, it is
removed from the list (although this behavior can be
suppressed). Using SpinWheel is a great way to fairly distribute
questions in the class and also get to know the names of your
students.

<p>

<b>Setup</b>: No accounts or logins required! Create a list of names
from the class roster (usually a spreadsheet). You can use full names,
or an abbreviated form, such as first name plus the inital of last
name. Join the names together, with a comma or a semicolon as the
separator, replacing any spaces in the names with plus (+) signs. Then
generate a URL string that looks like this: <br> <tt><a
href="http://pyintro.org/wheel/?session=math101&names=John+Smith;Jane+Doe;Gilgamesh">http://pyintro.org/wheel/?session=math101&names=John+Smith;Jane+Doe;Gilgamesh</a></tt>

<p>The above URL can be stored in a file and reused to restart a
session, as needed. Note that the query symbol (<tt>?</tt>) denotes
the start of the parameter list and the ampersand (<tt>&amp;</tt>)
separates different parameters. The optional <tt>session</tt>
parameter enables multiple parallel sessions. Another optional
parameter <tt>max</tt> may be used to specify the maximum number of
names displayed (default: 30). If there are more names than this
maximum, a random subset of consecutive names from the list is
pre-selected and displayed in the wheel. If the <tt>names</tt>
parameter is omitted, the list of comma- or semicolon-separated names
should be entered manually via a dialog box.

<p>
<b>Usage</b>: Click on SPIN to rotate the wheel. When a name is
selected, a dialog box will appear. Clicking <em>OK</em> will remove the
selected name from the list, clicking <em>Cancel</em> will retain the name.

<p> <b>Sessions</b>: A sequence of spins starting with a new list of
names is referred to as a <em>session</em>. The default session has a
blank name. Alternate session names are specified using the optional
<tt>session</tt> parameter in the URL and persist indefinitely in the
browser (using information stored in browser local
storage). <em>Restarting</em> a session will restore the original list
of names. <em>Clearing</em> a session will open a dialog box to enter
a new list of names.

<p>
<b>Sample URLs</b>:<br>
<tt><a
href="http://pyintro.org/wheel/">http://pyintro.org/wheel/</a></tt>
<em>Enter names via dialog box for default session</em>
<br>
<tt><a
href="http://pyintro.org/wheel/?names=JohnS,JaneD">http://pyintro.org/wheel/?names=JohnS,JaneD</a></tt>
<em>Default session, comma-separated first names+last initials</em>
<br>
<tt><a
href="http://pyintro.org/wheel/?session=calc101&max=15&names=John+Smith,
jr.;Jane+Doe">http://pyintro.org/wheel/?session=calc101&max=15&names=John+Smith,jr.;Jane+Doe</a></tt>
<em>Named session, semicolon-separated names, max. display of 15 names</em>

<p> <b>Code</b>: The source code is available on <a
href="https://github.com/mitotic/spinwheel">Github</a>. You can
download the code and open the <tt>www/index.html</tt> in your browser
to run SpinWheel locally, even without an internet connection, by appending
parameters to the file URL (<tt>.../index.html?names=...</tt>). To
customize, modify the <tt>www/index.html</tt> file.  
This implementation uses the jQuery
<a href="https://github.com/JavoByte/rouletteWheel">rouletteWheel</a>
code.

<p> <b>Notes:</b>
<ol>
<li>The maximum length of an URL is about 2000 characters. If names are
shortened to about 10 characters each, a maximum of about 200 names
can be handled in the URL. For a longer list, pasting into the dialog
box should work.
</li>
<li>An undocumented option <tt>stats=1</tt> can be specified to verify
the randomness of the selection algorithm.
