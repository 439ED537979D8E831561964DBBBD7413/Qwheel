# Wheel of Names 

## Description

This is a front-end implementation of a spinning "prize wheel" image
(+sound) to select a name from a list, based upon
[jQuery Roulette Wheel](https://github.com/JavoByte/rouletteWheel).
This can be used to randomly select students in a classroom to answer
questions (with or without replacement of names).

You can immediately use it at [pyintro.org](http://pyintro.org/wheel/)
without having to install any code. 

See the [help file](http://pyintro.org/wheel/help.html)
for more detailed usage info.

## Implementation

This project simply adds a landing page (``www/index.html``) with Javascript
and an audio file (``www/prize_wheel.mp3``) to
[jQuery Roulette Wheel](https://github.com/JavoByte/rouletteWheel) to
implement the web site.
